The RODEO ANR project is set to reshape surgical robotics by adapting cutting-edge AI. The project is conducted within the Machine Learning for Robotics (MLR) team at the  robotics lab (Institut des Syst√®mes Intelligents et de Robotique, ISIR), Sorbonne University (SU). \\
The practical testbed is robotics-guided spine surgery, based on a surgical platform available at ISIR.
